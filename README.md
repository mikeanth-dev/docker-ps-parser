# docker-ps-parser
A simple C++ program to extract the information from `docker ps` and neatly display it in a 80 character wide terminal.

## Why use docker-ps-parser?

Don't you just hate it when commands print their output with little to no regard of how it gets displayed in your terminal window? 

Are you not sick of having to resize either the text or the terminal in order to fit long strings of characters, that could have easily been arranged in a friendly looking table?
Wouldn't it be nice if that table was color coded, while we're at it?

To put it in a single sentence: Are you tired of `docker ps` printing stuff like this to your console?

Well look no further! Docker-ps-parser is here to save your day. This program will take all that hard to read and poorly formatted data and slap it into a nice, 80 character wide table:

"But wait!", I hear you say, "Can't you kinda sorta already do that with ` docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.Ports}}"`?". And you would be right...nerd. However, the way it handles multiple ports is still kind of funky and if you have more than, say, 3 ports on a single container, well then, we're back to ground zero:

Also, have you not seen the pretty colors in the table??
