# docker-ps-parser

A simple C++ program to extract the information from `docker ps` and neatly display it in a 80 character wide terminal.

## Why use docker-ps-parser?

Don't you just hate it when commands print their output with little to no regard of how it gets displayed in your terminal window? :rage:

Are you not sick of having to resize either the text or the terminal in order to fit long strings of characters, that could have easily been arranged in a friendly looking table?
Wouldn't it be nice if that table was color coded, while we're at it?

To put it in a single sentence: Are you tired of `docker ps` printing stuff like this to your console?

Well look no further! Docker-ps-parser is here to save your day. This program will take all that hard to read and poorly formatted data and slap it into a nice, 80 character wide table:

"But wait!", I hear you say, "Can't you kinda sorta already do that with `docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.Ports}}"`?". And you would be right ... nerd :nerd_face: . However, the way it handles multiple ports is still kind of funky and if you have more than, say, 3 ports on a single container, well then, we're back to ground zero:

Also, have you not seen the pretty colors in the table?? :heart_eyes:

## How to install

### Download the precompiled binaries

``` bash
wget https://github.com/mikeanth-dev/docker-ps-parser/releases/download/v1.0.0/dps
chmod +x ./dps; # make the file executable
sudo cp ./dps /bin/dps; # add it to path
```

### Build from source

Prerequisites:

- g++
- make

Clone this repository and compile the project via the makefile:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeanth-dvlp/docker-ps-parser.git;
cd docker-ps-parser;
make;
```

You should now have a new file called `dps` in that directory. You can execute it by running `./dps`. However, it would be more convenient to have it readily available at all times, so i recommend copying it to `/bin/` via : `sudo cp ./dps /bin/dps`.

## How to uninstall

Assuming you follwed the steps mentioned above, simply remove the binary you copied to `/bin` by `sudo rm /bin/dps`.
